Installation
------------
Installation uses python distutils. After extracting the archive, run:

    python setup.py install

If you are using Ubuntu 9.04 (Jaunty) or later, make sure to install with:

    python setup.py install --install-layout=deb

Don't forget to use sudo if necessary. This will install the arista python 
module to your python site-packages or dist-packages path, install the arista 
programs into sys.prefix/bin, instal the nautilus extensions into 
sys.prefix/lib/nautilus/extensions-2.0/python and install all data files into 
sys.prefix/share/arista.

You can also choose to install the Nautilus extension per-user by placing it 
into the user's home directory under ~/.nautilus/python-extensions. Note
that you must restart Nautilus for such changes to take effect!

Usage
-----
There are two clients available, a graphical client using GTK+ and a terminal 
client. The graphical client is failry self-explanatory and can be launched 
with:

    arista-gtk

To use the terminal client please see:

    arista-transcode --help

An example of using the terminal client:

    arista-transcode --device=ipod --preset=low test.mp4

Other useful terminal options:

    arista-transcode --info
    arista-transcode --info ipod

There is also a Nautilus extension installed by default. You can right-click on
any media file and select "Convert for device..." in the menu. This menu
contains all your installed presets and will launch Arista to convert the
selected file or files.

Generating a Test File
----------------------
Sometimes it may be useful to generate a test file:

    gst-launch-0.10 videotestsrc num-buffers=500 ! x264enc ! mp4mux ! filesink location=test.mp4

Creating New Device Presets
---------------------------
New device presets can be created via the [create preset](http://www.transcoder.org/presets/create/ "Create a new Arista Transcoder preset")
page on the website or by specifying information about yourself and 
the device you wish to support along with presets that describe how to create a
proper gstreamer pipeline to encode for the device in a JSON file.
